Pleae reconsider doing PermuTree E1 again as it was a very good problem and also the problem of partitioning an array into two subsets
such that subset's sum has minimum absolute differene which you solved on geeks for geeks, you grapsed the concept overall but theie were
confusions regarding the implementation of dp and why return are dp[0][0] (bottom up) and dp[n][0] top down these things must be cleared
when you get algorithmic maturity overall solid decent nice problem also the concept you got might not have been intuitively clear so it 
would be very good to do the whole problem
